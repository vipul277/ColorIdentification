# ColorIdentification
A color is nothing but a 3-dimensional array and the colors are red, green and blue so that is what we say as RGB. In the given code, I have used opencv and pandas libraries to identify a particular color from an image. I am taking the dataset in which we have color names and their corresponding hexadecimal values and the values of R,B and G. What we are going to do is we will take the closest value of R,B and G to get the color name and present the name and values of R,B,G to the user. So what we are going to do is when user clicks twice left click on the picture then they get the color name and their corresponding R,G and B values.
